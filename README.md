# Developer Setup

## Android

 * Install [**Android Studio**](https://developer.android.com/studio).
 * Clone the repository: `git clone git@github.com:asder8215/Budgiet.git`
 * Open the `Budgiet/android` directory with **Android Studio**.
  
   > After opening the project, you might not be able to build the app.
   > This is because gradle needs manual setup (not really).
   > On Android Studio, go to `Settings > Build, Execution, Deployment > Build Tools > Gradle`.
   > Set the `Gradle user home` option to `<your-user-home>/.gradle`,
   > and `Gradle JDK` to `GRADLE_LOCAL_JAVA_HOME` (or `<your-android-studio-install-dir>/jbr`).

 * Click on `Sync Project with Gradel Files`
   (the elephant icon with a down-left arrow on the right side of the top bar).
