 * > Note: disregard the following 2 paragraphs :D
 *
 * This function is only used for a developer to guess the type `T` of a [SemanticsPropertyKey]
 * and then implement the test with [getSemanticsProperty] with that type `T`.
 * [getSemanticsProperty] needs the generic for the **value**, but the **type** of the value is not immediately clear,
 * this function is necessary to be able to use the semantics properties at all.
 *
 * This pattern is certainly weird because the [SemanticsConfiguration] has accessor fields for each semantics property so that the developer does not need to ,
 * but none of them work because apparently it overrides [Map.get] to always throw an [java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException],
 * telling the caller to use *getOrNull* or *getOrElse* instead.
 *
 * ------
 *
 * Actually, nah bruh imbouta crash out. Went on this whole damn rabbit hole trying to figure out how on earth to get a Semantics property,
 * and the relevant classes have NO DOCUMENTATION WHATSOEVER on how the hell to do that.
 * Not to mention that when you type one of the SemanticsPropertyKeys (e.g. EditableText) to see what the IDE can recommend,
 * none of them come up even though they exist and are public.
 * Wasted 2 hours on this only to find an inconspicuous stack overflow post detailing the exact way to do it,
 * even though all my previous searches DID NOT come up with this post, and the search that did come up with this post was unrelated to Semantics properties.
 *
 * This function is no longer necessary, but im keeping this here out of spite. */
